Dear contributors,

We want to start off by saying thank you for using Continuous Perf Test. 
We appreciate all of the users that catch bugs, propose ideas and help with documentation. 

There are many different ways to contribute to Continuous Perf Test's development. 
Examples of contributions we would love to receive are the following :
* **Code patches**
* **Patch reviews**
* **Documentation improvements**
* **Bug reports**
* **Feature development**

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist please open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Coding guidelines
We use a very standard Github development process, using Github tracker for issues and merging pull requests into master. If you want to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but follow the guidelines below.

That being said, here are a few guidelines that we ask you to follow so we can successfully address your issue.
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help. They can also be added after the original pull request but before a merge.
* Use code format conventions stored in that repository.
* Make sure all new .java files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an @author tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.
* Add the GPL license header comment to all new .java files (copy from existing files in the project)
* Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well — someone has to do it.
* When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), if you are fixing an existing issue please add Fixes gh-XXXX at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).

Thank you for considering contributing to Continuous Perf Test. 
It’s people like you that make Continuous Perf Test such a great tool.
